Avro part (3 point)
- In this task, you need to create a Kafka producer and consumer using Avro to serialize messages.
- Create a simple Kafka producer that sends a simple message to a topic serializing it using Avro.
- Create a simple Kafka consumer which listens to a topic for a message, deserializes the message, and prints it.
- Start Kafka, create a topic, and run consumer and producer.
- Try to use different Avro schemas for serialization and deserialization. Include Avro schema version/id into the massage so a client can understand which schema to use.
